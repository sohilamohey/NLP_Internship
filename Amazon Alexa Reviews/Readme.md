   - Converting text to lowercase
   - Removing digits, symbols, and extra spaces
   - Eliminating stop words, special characters, and duplicate words
   - Removing emojis
4. **Vectorization Techniques:** Implementing methods like Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for text representation.
5. **Embedding Techniques:** Utilizing advanced embeddings such as Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, and Sentence Transformers to capture semantic meaning and context in the text.

The project aims to enhance understanding of customer opinions and identify key patterns and trends in Amazon Alexa reviews.
